THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY STACK FOR THE JOB AT HAND
Developers are constantly challenged with choosing the most effective runtime, programming model, and architecture for their application's requirements and team's skill set. For example, some use cases are best handled by a technology stack based on synchronous blocking I/O architecture, whereas others would be better served by an asynchronous, nonblocking stack built on the reactive design principles described in the Reactive Streams Specification.

Reactive Spring represents a platform-wide initiative to deliver reactive support at every level of the development stack: web, security, data, messaging, etc. Spring Framework 5 delivers on this vision by providing a new reactive web stack called Spring WebFlux, which is offered side by side with the traditional Spring MVC web stack. The choice is yours!

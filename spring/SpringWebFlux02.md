Notes on Reactive Programming Part I: The Reactive Landscape
### section 1
Reactive Programming is interesting (again) and there is a lot of noise about it at the moment, not all of which is very easy to understand for an outsider and simple enterprise Java developer, such as the author. This article (the first in a series) might help to clarify your understanding of what the fuss is about. The approach is as concrete as possible, and there is no mention of "denotational semantics". If you are looking for a more academic approach and loads of code samples in Haskell, the internet is full of them, but you probably don’t want to be here.

### word 1
landscape n. 风景，景色；山水画  
clarify vt. 澄清；阐明  
fuss n. 大惊小怪；反对，抗议；繁琐的手续；（为小事）大发牢骚  
approach n. 方法，方式；接近；接洽；（某事的）临近；路径；进场（着陆）；相似的事物
concrete adj. 混凝土的；实在的，具体的；有形的
mention n. 提及，说起  
denotational semantics [计] 指称语义  
academic adj. 学术的；理论的；学院的  

### section 2
Reactive Programming is often conflated with concurrent programming and high performance to such an extent that it’s hard to separate those concepts, when actually they are in principle completely different. This inevitably leads to confusion. Reactive Programming is also often referred to as or conflated with Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP (and we use the two interchangeably here). Some people think Reactive is nothing new, and it’s what they do all day anyway (mostly they use JavaScript). Others seem to think that it’s a gift from Microsoft (who made a big splash about it when they released some C# extensions a while ago). In the Enterprise Java space there has been something of a buzz recently (e.g. see the Reactive Streams initiative), and as with anything shiny and new, there are a lot of easy mistakes to make out there, about when and where it can and should be used.
